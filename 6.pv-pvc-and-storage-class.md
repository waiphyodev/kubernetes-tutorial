# PV, PVC and Storage Class

## Create PV (Persistent Volume)

### 1. Create `mongodb-pv.yaml` file

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
    name: mongodb-pv
    labels:
        type: local
spec:
    storageClassName: local-storage
    accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce     # https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#access-modes
    capacity:
        storage: 10Gi
    local:
        path: /mnt/data
    nodeAffinity:
        required:
            nodeSelectorTerms:
                - matchExpressions:
                    - key: kubernetes.io/hostname
                      operator: In
                      values:
                        - agb-worker    # node-name
```

input

```bash
kubectl apply -f manifest-file/mongodb-pv.yaml
```

output

```
persistentvolume/mongodb-pv created
```

input

```bash
kubectl get pv mongodb-pv
```

output

```
NAME         CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   RECLAIM POLICY   STATUS      CLAIM   STORAGECLASS   VOLUMEATTRIBUTESCLASS   REASON   AGE
mongodb-pv   10Gi       RWO            Retain           Available           manual         <unset>                          2s
```

### 2. Create `mongodb-pvc.yaml`

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
    name: mongodb-pvc
spec:
    storageClassName: local-storage
    accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
        requests:
            storage: 2Gi
```

input

```bash
kubectl apply -f manifest-files/mongodb-pvc.yaml
```

output

```
persistentvolumeclaim/mongodb-pvc created
```

input

```bash
kubectl get pvc mongodb-pvc
```

output

```
NAME          STATUS   VOLUME       CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   VOLUMEATTRIBUTESCLASS   AGE
mongodb-pvc   Bound    mongodb-pv   10Gi       RWO            local-storage         <unset>                 2m25s
```

input

```bash
kubectl get pv mongodb-pv
```

output

```
NAME         CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   RECLAIM POLICY   STATUS   CLAIM                 STORAGECLASS   VOLUMEATTRIBUTESCLASS   REASON   AGE
mongodb-pv   10Gi       RWO            Retain           Bound    default/mongodb-pvc   local-storage         <unset>                          12m
```

Managing storage is a distinct problem from managing compute instances. The PersistentVolume subsystem provides an API for users and administrators that abstracts details of how storage is provided from how it is consumed. To do this, we introduce two new API resources: PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim.

A PersistentVolume (PV) is a piece of storage in the cluster that has been provisioned by an administrator or dynamically provisioned using Storage Classes. It is a resource in the cluster just like a node is a cluster resource. PVs are volume plugins like Volumes, but have a lifecycle independent of any individual Pod that uses the PV. This API object captures the details of the implementation of the storage, be that NFS, iSCSI, or a cloud-provider-specific storage system.

A PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is a request for storage by a user. It is similar to a Pod. Pods consume node resources and PVCs consume PV resources. Pods can request specific levels of resources (CPU and Memory). Claims can request specific size and access modes (e.g., they can be mounted ReadWriteOnce, ReadOnlyMany, ReadWriteMany, or ReadWriteOncePod, see AccessModes).

While PersistentVolumeClaims allow a user to consume abstract storage resources, it is common that users need PersistentVolumes with varying properties, such as performance, for different problems. Cluster administrators need to be able to offer a variety of PersistentVolumes that differ in more ways than size and access modes, without exposing users to the details of how those volumes are implemented. For these needs, there is the StorageClass resource.
