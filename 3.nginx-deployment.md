# Nginx Deployment

## Create a deployment using nginx image

### 1. Create `nginx-deployment.yaml` file

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
    name: nginx-deployment
    labels:
        app: nginx
spec:
    replicas: 3
    selector:
        matchLabels:
            app: nginx
    template:
        metadata:
            labels:
                app: nginx
        spec:
            containers:
                - name: nginx
                  image: nginx:1.14.2
                  ports:
                      - containerPort: 80
```

A Deployment provides declarative updates for Pods, set of running containers in the cluster and ReplicaSets, ensure that a specified number of Pod replicas are running at one time.

### 2. Check deployment state over time with `kubectl get pods`

```
kubectl get pods
```

```
NAME                                READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-deployment-86dcfdf4c6-7pnwk   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          19s
nginx-deployment-86dcfdf4c6-mbssd   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          19s
nginx-deployment-86dcfdf4c6-tw5q7   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          19s
```

```
kubectl get pods
```

```
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-deployment-86dcfdf4c6-7pnwk   1/1     Running   0          57s
nginx-deployment-86dcfdf4c6-mbssd   1/1     Running   0          57s
nginx-deployment-86dcfdf4c6-tw5q7   1/1     Running   0          57s
```

As we declare, 3 pods are running.

### 3. Delete pods with `kubectl delete pod <pod-name>`, to ensure the replica set

```
kubectl delete pod nginx-deployment-86dcfdf4c6-7pnwk
```

```
pod "nginx-deployment-86dcfdf4c6-7pnwk" deleted
```

```
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

```
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE    IP           NODE          NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
nginx-deployment-86dcfdf4c6-j5xdt   1/1     Running   0          3s     10.244.2.3   agb-worker    <none>           <none>
nginx-deployment-86dcfdf4c6-mbssd   1/1     Running   0          108m   10.244.2.2   agb-worker    <none>           <none>
nginx-deployment-86dcfdf4c6-tw5q7   1/1     Running   0          108m   10.244.1.2   agb-worker2   <none>           <none>
```

A pod has been replaced.

### 4. Scale up and down the replicas with `kubectl scale deployment <deployment-name>`

#### input

```
kubectl scale deployment nginx-deployment --replicas=4
```

#### output

```
deployment.apps/nginx-deployment scaled
```

#### input

```
kubectl get pods
```

#### output

```
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS        AGE
nginx-deployment-86dcfdf4c6-j5xdt   1/1     Running   1 (6d17h ago)   7d10h
nginx-deployment-86dcfdf4c6-mbssd   1/1     Running   1 (6d17h ago)   7d12h
nginx-deployment-86dcfdf4c6-tw5q7   1/1     Running   1 (6d17h ago)   7d12h
nginx-deployment-86dcfdf4c6-zbpbf   1/1     Running   0               11s
```

A pod has been added.

At this point, we haven't accessed to our containers yet. We need to create a servce.
